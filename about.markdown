My name is Kanghun Lee and I am interested in computer security, anything ranging from pure mathematics to down-to-earth computer engineering. I grew up in South Korea up until 12 and moved to Canada where I was educated to high school. I am on leave from University of Toronto and I am currently based in South Korea.
