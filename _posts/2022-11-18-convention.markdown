# Proofs are meant to be concise
Mathematical proofs are written in a way to efficiently deliver the idea and are not necessarily intended to explain the concepts.

# Sufficient explanations for ideas are given
Though proofs are written concisely, the ideas presented in the proofs are explained sufficiently in a way to help myself understand the concepts. This does not necessarily mean that readers will think and digest them in a similar way.
